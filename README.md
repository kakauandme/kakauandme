Software engineer and co-founder of legal tech start-up Josef, with over 13 years of experience across non-profit, government, start-ups and agency work.

## Personal

When I'm not developing tech, you'll find me in nature or art. From surfing to cycling, Solstice Swims at Dark Mofo, and even running a marathon in Vietnam following a lost bet, I find balance when outdoors. I love to challenge myself and am never afraid of new heights, personally and professionally.
